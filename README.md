# MemeStocks
Tracks the frequency of stock memtions among a list of twitter usernames and outputs a leaderboard

## TODO

- filter out trash tags
- track increases/decreases in frequency 
- add other social medias 
- make a nice frontend
- mongodb instead of json files
- multithreading w/ proxy switching for large number of usernames
- weight stock mentions by 
  - "freshness" 
  - previous tweeter performance (historical market data)
  - other metrics?
